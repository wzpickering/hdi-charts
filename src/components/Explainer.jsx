        The HDI is a composite score that combines GDP per capita, life
        expectancy, and education attainment. It is widely considered to be the
        most comprehensive measurement of a country or region's overall economic
        development, each of whom are assigned a value between zero and one. All
        of the data is courtesy of the United Nations Development Program API.
